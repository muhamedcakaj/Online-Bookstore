# Online-Bookstore
This code is a Java program that simulates a bookstore's user interface. It allows users to either log in or sign up as a customer, and gives administrators the ability to add and remove books from the bookstore's inventory.
When the program starts, the user is presented with three options: Administrator, User, or Exit. If the user chooses Administrator, they are prompted to enter a name and password. If the credentials are correct, the administrator is presented with options to add a book, remove a book, or exit. If the user chooses User, they are prompted to log in or sign up. If they choose to log in, they are prompted to enter their name and password. If the credentials are correct, the user is presented with options to search for a book, add a book to their shopping cart, view their shopping cart, view their payment history, checkout, or exit. If the user chooses to sign up, they are prompted to enter a name and password.
